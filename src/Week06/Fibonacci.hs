---------------------------  Exercise 1

--------------------------- Exercise 3

data Stream a = Cons a (Stream a)

--------------------------- Exercise 4

--------------------------- Exercise 5

nats =
  streamFromSeed (+ 1) 0

-- When right folding you can't force the accumulator and stay lazy.
-- Using `~` in front of a pattern makes it lazy, the match will only be performed
-- when a value from it is demanded.
-- This is sugar over performing the match in a `let` binding, which desugars to
-- performing it in a lambda ... you might see where this is going.
-- There are other (simpler) ways to defer this match per itereration ...
-- ask Lord Bow :P
-- You can write this without streamFold, and in a way that doesn't need
-- interleaveStream to be lazy in it's second arg ... but it's less elegant.
